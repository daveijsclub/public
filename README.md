# Public repo of [Dave Druiven]

Public repo with example scripts I wrote. It is a reference and not all I can code, just examples with fictive or anonymous values.

I have coding experience in PHP, HTML, Ansible YML, Azure Devops, Powershell, Batch and some visual basic basics ;)

AI USE
-------
I use AI to comment files or make commit push messages.
Generative AI is a tool, but should be used with great caution due to security risks. For that reason I only use it to make comment sections and readme files.
